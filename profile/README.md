Multi-agent software forge — coordinating AI agents to build, test, and ship software.

## What we're building

**Forge** — a Beads-coordinated system where multiple AI agents collaborate on software projects, from planning through deployment.

**Arena** — an eSports platform, built and maintained by forge agents as a real-world proving ground.

## Exploration

Our research into agent architectures, coordination patterns, and deployment strategies is public:
